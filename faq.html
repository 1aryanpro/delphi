	    <h3 class="title q">Why did you decide to make this product?</h3>
	  	<p class="ans"><span class="spacer"></span>Our teacher gave us a new project in which we had to come up with a product or performance that improved people's lives. Learn more on the About Us page.</p>
			<h3 class="title q">What is the difference between this and other medical bracelets?</h3>
    	<p class="ans"><span class="spacer"></span>Other medical bracelets do not have a QR code, so they are limited by the amount of space on the bracelet. For them to provide all of the helpful medical information, a user would have to wear many bracelets. With a QR code, we can add much more information on the same amount of space.</p>
			<h3 class="title q">Have you researched the information that needs to be on the bracelet?</h3>
	  	<p class="ans"><span class="spacer"></span>Yes. A big part of this project was spent researching about our product. We went to a local fire station to learn about what information they need when they arrive at an emergency. The firemen and women helped us a lot by explaining what equipment they bring, what they look for, and what information is useful. We made sure to incorperate this into our product.</p>
